🐾 Petzy – Pet Care App

This project is my submission for the React Native Intern position at Bits and Volts.

Petzy is a mobile application focused on pet adoption and pet supplies. I developed the app to closely match the provided design while enhancing the overall user experience with smooth, subtle animations. The goal was to create an interface that feels modern, responsive, and easy to use.

✨ Key Features
🎨 Pixel-Perfect Design

Carefully matched the provided UI design, including colors, rounded corners, spacing, and shadows

Focused on maintaining visual consistency across all screens

🎬 Smooth Animations
hello 
Screen content fades in and slides upward for a polished entrance effect

Pet cards and buttons slightly scale down on press to provide visual feedback

🧭 Custom Navigation

A fixed bottom navigation bar remains visible while switching between screens

The active tab expands into a green pill indicator to clearly show the current screen

⚙️ Functional Logic

Search: Users can filter pets in real time using the search bar

Cart: The total price updates automatically when item quantities change

Favorites: Pets can be saved by tapping the heart icon
